      Written for you , sealed with a kiss,<br>
      <br><br>
      My friendship with you is special and true.<br>
      When we are together, we stick like glue.<br>
      When I'm in the darkness that needs some light,<br>
      When you're by my side, I know things are all right.<br>
      <br>
      Our friendship is so strong; it breaks down bars.<br>
      Our friendship is also bright, like the sun and the stars.<br>
      If we were in a competition for friendships, we would get a gold,<br>
      Because responsibility and cleverness are the keys we hold.<br>
      <br>
      When you're feeling down and blue,<br>
      And life is being cruel to you,<br>
      Just remember you're not on your own.<br>
      I'm always there; you're never alone.<br>
      You might not be able to see my face,<br>
      As hard as you look around the place,<br>
      But close your eyes and think of me,<br>
      And before you know it, there will be me.<br>
      Keep me in the midst of your mind,<br>
      And life will seem easier, I think you'll find,<br>
      So when life gets too dark to bear,<br>
      Just close your eyes and I will be there.<br>
      <br>
      I met you as a stranger, took you as a friend.<br>
      I hope our long friendship will never end.<br>
      Our friendship is like a magnet; it pulls us together,<br>
      Because no matter where we are, our friendship will last forever!<br>
      <br>
      I have a feeling<br>
      That I can't comprehend.<br>
      In my deepest thoughts you are<br>
      More than just a friend.<br>
      <br>
      I'll love you tomorrow,<br>
      I'll love you today,<br>
      I'll love you forever,<br>
      And forever always.<br>
